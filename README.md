# Review-Analysis-using-NLP

This cellphone review system using NLP and sentiment analysis can help analyze and classify the sentiment expressed in user reviews of cell phones. Here's a general outline of how this works.

After extraction and pre-processing of the data apply sentiment analysis techniques to the preprocessed text to determine the sentiment expressed in each review. We have used Keras sequential model in this project.

Once the sentiment analysis model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to classify new, unseen reviews. Feed the preprocessed text of a review into the model, and it will predict the sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral) based on the learned patterns.

# User Interface

Below given is a simple user interface using Bootstrap. The user can enter their review and can predict it using the predict button.

# Positive review

Now, we have entered a positive review taken from the Amazon website, and let's check it with the model.
